# li-mlflow-playground

MLflow Playground inspired by [MLflow Tracking Quickstart](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/getting-started/intro-quickstart/index.html).

1. Install MLflow locally
2. Run a local MLflow Tracking Server
3. Train a model as usual
4. Log the model and its metadata to MLflow
5. Load the model as a Python Function & use it for inference
6. View the Run in the MLflow UI

All in the Jupyter Notebook
